Programming Languages By Decade

Turing Machine -> John Neumann -> imperative/procedural languages

1950s
	Fortran (1957)

	Lisp (1958)
		comes from lambda calculus
		many functional programming languages derive from LISP
	Cobol (1959)
1960s
	Algol (1960)
		introduced call by value and call by reference
	-Multiprocessing was developed in 60s
	-time-sharing allowed multiple remote users to share use of a computer
	Basic (1964)
		-allow students to write mainframe computer programs
		-intended for less technical users
		-early microsoft used basic -> now visual basic
	B (1969)
		-developed by bell labs
		- operators ++, --, etc
1970s
	C (1972)
		-developed by bell labs
		-used to re-implement unix operating system
		-high level assembly language
		-minimal runtime support
		-access memory efficiently
	Smalltalk (1972)
		-object oriented, dynamically types, reflective language
		-created for educational use
		-derived from simula
	Prolog (1977)
		-logic programming
		-roots in first-order logic
		-is declarative
		-has facts and rules
1980s
	SQL (1983)
		-used for managing data in a relational database management system
		developed at IBM
	C++ (1983)
	Objective-C (1984)
		-general purpose & object-oriented
		-can compile any c program with an obejctive c compiler
		-was maing languaged used for OSX and iOS
		-uses message passing to object instances
		-more dynamic than c++
			-in simula based (C++) method name is usually bound to a section of code
			-in smalltalk based, target of a message is resolved at runtime
	Erlang (1986)
		-originally a proprietary language
	Perl (1987)
		-general-purpose Unix scripting language for report processing
1990s
	Haskell (1990)
		-effort to standardize functional languages
		-has type inference
		-has lazy evaluation: won't compute anything until needed
	Python (1991)
		-dynamic type, automatic memory management, multiple paradigms
			-object-oriented, imperative, functional, procedural
		-large standard library
	Java (1995)
		-write once, run anywhere
			-programs compiled to bytecode
	JavaScript (1995)
	Ruby (1995)
	XML (1998)
2000s
	R (2000)
	C# (2000)
	Scala (2004)
	F# (2005)
	Clojure (2007)
	GO (2009)
2010s
	Rust (2010)
